# EaseSub - Subscription Management Platform

The subscription economy is booming, projected to reach **$1.5 trillion by 2025** 📈. EaseSub leverages **Web3** and the stability of **Ethena's USDe stablecoin** to transform subscription payments—offering a seamless, transparent, and borderless platform 🌐.  

Say goodbye to volatility and high fees 🙌, and hello to the future of recurring services!

### Note on Deployment Challenges

During our participation in the Ethena Hackathon, we faced challenges with deployment and using **USDe as a currency**. This was due to the unavailability of the Ethena testnet and faucet in our country, Ethiopia.  

After consulting with the Ethena team, we switched to an alternative testnet and currency, assuming USDe functionality for consistency as we continue development. 

We appreciate your understanding and look forward to showcasing our work! 🚀
